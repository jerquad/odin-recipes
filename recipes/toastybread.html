        <p class="libox">What is a proper meal without piping hot fresh bread? Not a meal I want!</p>
        <h2 class="head">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="libox">
            <li>A loaf of your favorite bread, I recommend something long and crusty</li>
            <li>Butter (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="head">Steps</h2>
        <ol class="libox">
            <li>Get the oven goin' real hot, maybe broil? Or close to it, whatever.</li>
            <li>Slice the bread, you can go perpendicular if you like order and maximizing your
                bread usage. I like that.  Some people will slice it diagonally, this makes for
                "bigger bread" which is great, but if you are not using the whole loaf that's a lot
                more surface to get stale.
            </li>
            <li>Put the slices into the over.  On the rack is fine, who cares?</li>
            <li>Do not forget about the bread, take 'em out when the bread is "good".</li>
            <li>(Optional) spread butter to one side of the bread.  Avoid the temptation to Butter
                the other side as well.
            </li>
        </ol>
