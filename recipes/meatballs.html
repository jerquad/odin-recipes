        </p>
        <p class="libox">
            The secret is in using both meat and sauce.
        </p>
        <h2 class="head">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="libox">
            <li>Something like two pounds of 85/15 ground beef</li>
            <li>A white onion</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Bread Crumbs, panko if you are fancy</li>
            <li>Two of the big cans of diced tomatoes, fireroasted if you are a little chef</li>
            <li>A tube of Tomato paste</li>
            <li>Olive Oil</li>
            <li>Parmesian Cheese</li>
            <li>"Italian" herbs, doesn't require any proof of residence</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="head">Directions</h2>
        <ol class="libox">
            <li>Choppa the onion as fine as you can.</li>
            <li>Smash, peel, choppa the garlic</li>
            <li>In a big pot sautee half the onions for a few minutes, then throw in the garlic, blast it
                with some of those italian herbs, some salt, and some pepper.  Once that smells nice,
                give it a blast of the old tomato paste, mix it all up now it looks like we know what 
                we're doing. Throw the contents of the cans of tomatoes into the pot,grate that parm into the 
                mix, glug glug the olive oil in there and give it a stir.
                Bring the whole thing up to a boil, reduce the heat and cover, let it simmer for half an hour
                or until you're done with the next few steps.
            </li>
            <li>Deep tissue massage the ground beef, eggs (cracked you nincompoop),
                half the onions, and a whole heap of the breadcrumbs together in a bowl.
            </li>
            <li>Roll that meat into balls of your preferred size, I like 'em maybe the size of 
                one and a half golfballs.
            </li>
            <li>Pan sear those balls until they are nice and browned on the outside.</li>
            <li>Uncover the sauce and either use a hand blender or if you are wicked brave
                use a food processor to get that sauce nice and smooth.
            </li>
            <li>Dump the balls into the sauce. Make sure they are drowining in it. Cover and let 
                simmer for 30 minutes or whatever. Ta da, it's a meatball time!
            </li>
        </ol>
