        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Don't let anyone tell you that you need to make your own spaghetti. That's maybe a fun
            activity if you have nothing else to do, but the store bought dehydrated kind is honestly
            it's own thing and it is wicked tasty.  Also not pretentious.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Box of your choice of dehydrated spaghetti</li>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill a big pot with water and add salt.  Bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>Add the dry spaghetti.  Make sure it's all nice and underwater</li>
            <li>In a couple of minutes, once the spaghetti is soft, start regularly pulling
                out strands and eating them.
            </li>
            <li>Once the strands are done, or even better, <em>almost done</em>, drain the pasta
                into a collendar (sp? lol). Tada, you made spaghetti!
            </li>
        </ol>
